			<h1>Hi! I'm Qingyuan.</h1>

			<p><i>Iâ€™m a first year ECE Master's student at the University specializing in Software Engineer. My background, however, was in Power Engineering. I completed my undergrad at The University of Shanghai for Science and Technology(USST) in 2018 with a major in Electrical Engineering and Automation.<p> 
            <br>
			<p>After graduated from USST, I studied at Duke University for Computer Engineering and received Duke ECE merited scholarship. At Duke University, I began my career as a software developer.Since the programming ability and the understanding of the computer architecture become increasingly important, I took the courses programming data structure algorithm in C++, Theory/Practice of algorithms, fundamental computer system & engineering. 
            My undergraduate study, weighing on power, is completely divergent from the programming-oriented knowledge system. After one semester study, I found myself still have a lot to improve and I never give up. I believe I need to put what I learned from class into practice in order to be a solid software engineer. Therefore, I quited from Duke University and took 4 months to study the full stack development and built an online shopping website by using these knowledge.</p>
            <br>
			<p>Study at University of Michigan, I took the EECS484 Database management system(Using SQL, JDBC and MongoDB), SI539 Complex Website Design(Using Html, CSS, Javascript), SI664 Database Application Design(Using Django), SI507 Intermediate Programming(Using Flask). </p>
            <br>
            <p>I like the front-end engineer work, since I love creating beautiful webpage, I will have a sense of satisfaction when I see the website that I built. Therefore, I become a patient and positive person from these kind of exiperience.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I'm not thinking and talking about coding. I'm constantly on the road. I love traveling.</p>
